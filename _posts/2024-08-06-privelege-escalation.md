## [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/)
GTFOBins is a curated list of Unix binaries that can be used to bypass local security restrictions in misconfigured systems.

The project collects legitimate functions of Unix binaries that can be abused to ~~get the fuck~~ break out restricted shells, escalate or maintain elevated privileges, transfer files, spawn bind and reverse shells, and facilitate the other post-exploitation tasks.

It is important to note that this is not a list of exploits, and the programs listed here are not vulnerable per se, rather, GTFOBins is a compendium about how to live off the land when you only have certain binaries available.

GTFOBins is a collaborative project created by Emilio Pinna and Andrea Cardaci where everyone can contribute with additional binaries and techniques.

#### **If you are looking for Windows binaries you should visit LOLBAS.**

## [Static Binaries](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/tree/master)
Contains a bunch of statically-linked binaries of various tools, along with the Dockerfiles / other build scripts that can be used to build them. I generally just create these as I need them - not all tools are available for every platform or architecture.
